# VotePause

Give every player the ability to call for a pause or to resume the game.

## Usage
- `/votepause` `/vp` add your vote to the running pause vote. If half of the players on the server have voted for a pause in the last minute, the game will be paused.
- `/voteresume` `/vr` add your vote to the running resume vote. Same rules as above.

## Installation
This is a server-side plugin, so the person running the server has to install it. The other people on the server don't have to do anything.

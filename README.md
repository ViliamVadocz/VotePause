# VotePause

Give every player the ability to call for a pause or to resume the game.

## Usage
- `/votepause` `/vp` add your vote to the running pause vote. If half of the players on the server have voted for a pause in the last minute, the game will be paused.
- `/voteresume` `/vr` add your vote to the running resume vote. Same rules as above.

## Installation
This is a server-side plugin, so the person running the server has to install it. The other people on the server don't have to do anything.

The mod is available on the Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3497097214
